# Calendar Tracker

MacOS app written with Swift and SwiftUI which tracks the number of events and the total duration in hours of events between selected dates in your Apple calendars.

Note: If selecting more than a 4-year period, the app will only display events within the most recent 4 years, as Apple currently only returns events within a 4-year time span for performance reasons.
When you select a start date it will display all events from the beginning of that day, and the end date includes all events up until the end (midnight) of that date.

Also works as an iOS app.
